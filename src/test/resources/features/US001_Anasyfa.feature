  As a user
  I want to access the home page when the app is launched
  So that I can see the site logo and start using the app

  Background:
    * User makes driver adjustments
  
  Scenario: Home page is displayed upon app launch
    * User verifies the button with description "Categories"
    * User fast confirms to be on the homepage
